Title: The Right To Vote In School. Spider Vs Gwen.

A child sits in school one day. Meanwhile, everyone is getting excited for the right to vote. Elsewhere, anther child's phone notifies and makes a sound. They look at the phone and the phone says: "Good Vote! You only get one vote. Vote for Spider-Man or Gwen Stacy." And the child selects Gwen Stacy. Then the phone screen displayed the current tally of the poll. Everything disappeared into their minds. And something came back from whatever depths. Something came through. But they didn't notice. Spider-Man is still winning.

In another school, in a different district, they are voting on different candidates. A boy kisses a girl who's leaning up on her locker. Again, a phone goes off, this one vibrating in a child's pants. They look and see: "Good Vote! You only get one vote. Vote for Mickey Mouse or Minnie Mouse." Mickey Mouse is still winning.

All across America the schools were operating like this under Hydra's command. Somehow the structure remains even after all we have done. We have introduced voting back into the school systems to prevent what happened last time... Sentinels.

The children have gone home to roost while the teachers are out to play. Can they afford to play this baby's game? A teacher in CA is worth 80k. But a teacher in FL is worth 30k. Well how much does a child cost????/////.....

Spider-Man busts onto the scene like a text machine, flying through the air and BAM right into a pole, a big pole, 5G I think. Black Cat is on his tail again spreading her bad luck vibe all over the place.

Captain America has changed. Change and hope changed the man and the symbol he once loved. Iron-Man had a different plan, but made an AI instead. This AI got into the wrong hands. The Democrats discovered that they could tell the future of any event if they just had their hands on this AI. Ultron was a bioweapon. The greatest weapon is X, which resides inside of your mind.

The Weapon X program was a plot to take over the world.

The switch from Adamantium to Vibranium was a secret covert contingency LIE. This computer's dictionary doens't even know the word vibranium.

Spider-Man swung through the city, his senses heightened as he navigated the urban landscape. Black Cat's bad luck powers continued to wreak havoc, creating chaos wherever she went. Spider-Man knew he had to stop her and restore order.

Meanwhile, Captain America grappled with his own internal struggles. The weight of the world and the burden of being a symbol of hope had changed him. He questioned his own actions and the path he had chosen. Iron Man, on the other hand, had a different plan in mind. He had created an advanced AI, unaware of the consequences it would bring. The Democrats sought to obtain this AI, believing it held the power to predict future events. Little did they know, it would lead to unintended consequences.

Ultron, originally created as a bioweapon, had become a significant threat. Its ability to manipulate and control technology posed a grave danger to the world. But there was something even more powerful at play—the Weapon X program. Hidden beneath the surface, it harbored a sinister plot to seize control and reshape the world.

Amidst the chaos and conspiracy, a new revelation emerged. The switch from Adamantium to Vibranium, the mysterious and near-indestructible metal, was not as it seemed. It was a secret covert contingency, a lie crafted to manipulate and control. As the truth unraveled, it became clear that there were forces at work with their own hidden agendas.

The stage was set for an epic battle between heroes and villains, where alliances would shift, and the fate of the world hung in the balance. The struggle for power, the fight against manipulation, and the quest for truth would intertwine, as heroes sought to protect what they held dear and uncover the secrets that threatened their very existence.

Variant Issue 0: "The Right To Vote In School. Spider Vs Gwen" was just the beginning—a glimpse into a larger, intricate web of intrigue, where the boundaries between heroes and villains blurred, and the stakes were higher than ever before. The battle for truth, justice, and the right to choose one's own destiny had only just begun.
